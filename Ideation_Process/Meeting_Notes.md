<ins>Next To Do:</ins>
 1. Find a data set we both interesting 
    how: put the data set link you interested on the teams (prefer no more than 3) and attached with a simple accommend reason until next meeting
 2. Brainstorming and pick a final data set 
    how: brainstroming
 3. Try to come up with a specific question
 4. Mika will set up a repository on Github to share code and a Trello Board to arrange next tasks once we have more information

### Meeting  4: April 5, 2021
Goal: Share preliminary sketches and Ideas
- Explain the structure of the repository so we can ensure less confusion when writing code with current testing visualisation (Chord Diagram).
    - Agreed the code will be a lot easier to read if its split with one javascript file per visualisation
- Discussed what we had thought of and divided who is going to do which in depth sketches
    - Really liked sunburst graph for languages, SBS box plot for rating, but looking for more ideas from: [Observable](https://observablehq.com) and [D3 Graph Gallery](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com).
